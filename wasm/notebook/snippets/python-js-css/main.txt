#  RustPython Notebook: python, javascript, css, markdown and math 


Python in the browser is fun. Python and Javascript working together is double
the fun ðŸ˜œ. Markdown and math are good for communicating ideas ðŸ¤” (especially
scientific ones). Adding css to the mix, makes everything look pretty âœ¨. 

--- 

In this demo example, the RustPython Notebook:
- runs JS to create a user interface. 
- the reader can input data, you can do js validation on that input.
- the dynamically created HTML element (with JS) can be made to execute a python function (on click for example)
- the data is passed from Javascript back to Python
- you can run analysis or simulation in python
- the results are displayed with python
- or data can be visualized quickly in the browser with a js vis library.
- everything is styled with css, neatly.
- everything runs in the browser, even on your phone, no servers.
- there are tabs to create multiple documents
- the split view lets you multi-task
